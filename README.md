#### Hello, world! Welcome to my github profile.  

- 👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel Campos. I am an Analytics Engineer driven by the passion for turning data into insights and solutions. I approach my work with a unique perspective, combining my technical skills with a background in economics to drive impact through data-driven strategies. I enjoy taking on complex challenges, from designing and implementing data pipelines to developing and deploying data warehouses or predictive models. I specialize in the Modern Data Stack approach using dbt. However I have experience with a variety of data tools and technologies, which allows me to bridge the gap between data and decision-making. Let's connect and see how we can work together to drive results and drive impact!
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Engineer, Analytics Engineer, data build tool (dbt), Data Science, Econometrics, Statistics, Python, R, SQL and other related contents.
